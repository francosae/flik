## Inspiration
We wanted to create a social media app similar to BeReal that gave users a fun and engaging way to connect using daily generating photo prompts.

## What it does
Every 24 hours, Flik generates a new prompt for users to respond to. They use the Flik app to share their responses to their friends. Flik users have a profile page, daily feed, explore page, and friends page to engage with others.

## How we built it
* React Native
* NativeBase
* Expo
* Firebase

## Usage
Clone the repository and install dependencies 
```
npm install
```
Next, run Expo
```
expo start
```
That's it! You can scan the QR Code in the Expo Go App.

## Challenges we ran into
Since it was our first time developing a mobile app, we ran into some problems getting the app setup in the beginning. We couldn't figure out how to display the app on multiple devices and since we all didn't have Macs, it was harder to view our iPhone screens in real time. We also had a bit of difficulty setting up the Firebase database since was also had no prior experience with it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to showcase our working feed page, profile page, friends page, and image upload system.

## What we learned
We learned how to use react native and firebase, two technologies we had never used before.

## What's next for Flik.
We are planning on adding the countdown timer and AI generated prompts everyday for users.
